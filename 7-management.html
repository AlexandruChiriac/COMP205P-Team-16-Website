							<h4>Project Objectives</h4>
							<p>The team were assigned the task of developing an application, using Blockchain, which would be</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Practical. The application would meet the client requirement in a straight forward and effective way, addressing the full end-to-end requirement</li>
								<li>An effective use of Blockchain. The application would address a need that was suited to Blockchain, for example to share information securely between two parties where no implicit “Trust” had previously been established.</li>
								<li>Commercially applicable. The application would have the potential to be developed commercially, for example by being based on tried and tested, scalable, open source technology while addressing a need which would draw in a large user base.</li>
								<li>Visually Appealing. The finished application would look appealing and be easy to use</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Blockdocs</h4>
							<p>The team developed 5 potential ideas, ranging from Blockchain applications for encouraging re-cycling, to reducing election fraud, to providing a secure, digital Notary Public service.
							These ideas were scored using a range of criteria, and the Notary Public idea was deemed to be the most practical, best use of blockchain, with commercial appeal. For this reason, the team decided to design and develop a system that would allow overseas students to validate their studentship documents and exchange them securely with third parties, using Blockchain to verify immutability the genuine status of those studentship documents.</p>
							<h4>Client Requirements</h4>
							<p>Through a process of negotiation, the team drew up a set of requirements which I was happy to sign off, by means of an email confirming that I was in agreement.</p>
								<p>Blockdocs must provide a facility for users to</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Upload documents</li>
									<li>Sign their documents</li>
									<li>Verify that documents have been signed</li>
									<li>Administer the system, for example, adding or deleting users</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Blockdocs should</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Have a dual user interface tuned for the needs of students and educational institutions</li>
									<li>Be able to provide for multiple signatures of a document</li>
									<li>Be easy to navigate</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Blockdocs could</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Be developed using Open APIs so that further development might extend functionality to include ideas such as</li>
								<ul>
									<li>A document wallet for other student records, such as exam results or residence papers
</li>
									<li>Smart contracts for the release of funding on production of documents
</li>
									<li>Interfaces to smart objects such as ID Wristbands to allow IOT connectivity as a user interface</li>
								</ul>
									<li>Have one such Smart Contract built in as an executable function</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Client Feedback</h4>
								<h5>Achievement of Objectives</h5>
								<p>As the client for this project, I confirm that all Blockdocs objectives were met. Specifically</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The team have demonstrated the Student and University user interfaces</li>
									<li>They also showed documents being uploaded, signed and verified, with multiple signatures</li>
									<li>The administrator’s interface was built though did not have a UI
										<ul>
											<li>In summary, the team were able to develop a Dual User Interface, with Admin facilities, admirably meeting all “Must Have” and “Should Have” requirements
											</li>
											<li>“could” and “would” requirements were also met, through use of open source methods such as MongoDB and Ethereum</li>
											<li>Specifically, the team should be congratulated on incorporating smart contract functionality, through the use of Ethereum to enable the addition of the uploaded document to the Blockchain</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>My advice to the team would be to continue to test the User Interface, perhaps using colleagues who are not familiar with the project objectives, in order to test how intuitive the interface would be
										<ul>
										<li>The UI was deliberately clean and minimal and pleasing to the eye, using a very modern colour palette</li>
										<li>However, one or two small “ease of use” enhancements would be helpful. The team should consider greater separation between the “upload a document” function and the document list. Also, they should consider the position on the screen of the Verify function</li>
										<li>As a customer I might be inclined to raise a Change Request to allow the Student to view the verification status of the blockchain document</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Technical Aspects</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>The team rapidly surpassed my own understanding of technical issues but appear to have made effective use of MongoDB, Ethereum and other open source tools</li>
									<li>Additionally, they have prepared a Technical Architecture summary to explain to the non-expert how the solution works</li>
									<li>I initially struggled to understand the NoSQL database architecture, but on request, they produced a 1 page summary of the schema, outlining how the Student, Document, Signature and Signature Status entities were interrelated. The database was appropriate, though there is scope to add a Verification Status field to prevent the need to keep checking verification status of documents and thus reduce cost in cryptocurrency to the user</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Project Management</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>This has been a very well managed project and congratulations are due to the Project Manager and the team</li>
									<li>Overall, client meetings were well managed. The team were unfailingly prompt, presentable and articulate and meetings were interactive and productive</li>
									<li>All team members took on board my advice on project planning and testing and I received regular status updates
									</li>
									<li>The team took on board advice about segregation of duties to allow parallel development of the Blockchain and smart contract engine, the User Interface and End-to-End user journey and the database</li>
									<li>Additionally, they left sufficient time at the end for unit tested components to be integrated and integration tested and they prepared Checkpoint Reports in December (with an excellent YouTube Video) and in April, with a presentation</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Final Presentation (face to face and Skype)</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>The final presentation demonstrated the end-to-end journey and ran without any bugs</li>
									<li>The team then progressed to a static presentation illustrating the requirement, the approach and the technical architecture</li>
									<li>All team members participated in all aspects of the project, however as mentioned above, the Project Manager took the most active role</li>
									<li>One team member was unable to make the final presentation, having been stuck in a Lawyer’s office awaiting an official stamp on their studentship documents, which provided the best possible justification for Blockdocs as a viable, practical and innovative solution which would have commercial potential</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Well done to the team. It has been a pleasure working with them and on behalf of all of us at Atos and the Atos Scientific Community, I would like to wish them the best of luck with their future endeavours</p>

										<td>Mike Smith, Atos Blockchain Teams, Atos Coaches</td>
										<td><b>Introdution</b><br>Mike Smith introduced us to our contact in Atos, Andy Wallace. Later, he told the 4 Atos Blockchain teams more about Atos and its IT Challenge, in which we are all automatically competing. Lastly, Mike gave us a glance about Blockchain, its advantages and disadvantages, and provided us with some materials to start our research from.</td>

										<td>Andy Wallace from Atos, Sadir, Kristelle, Alex</td>
										<td><b>Requirements</b><br>This meeting marked our first encounter with our client Andy Wallace during which we discussed the project and what is expected of us. We were not given any specific requirements, and we were told we needed to come up with our own idea to work on for this project. Our client gave us some examples such as the driverless cars, and advised to look for a situation where there is a lack of trust between 2 parties, and hence where Blockchain can applied. We asked questions about the utility and feasibility of using Blockchain in certain domains. To conclude, this meeting helped us have a better image of Blockchain and IoT, even though we had to come up with our own requirements (and get our client’s approval).</td>

									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>28/10/2016</td>
										<td>Andy Wallace, Sadir, Alex</td>
										<td><b>Our ideas</b><br>During this meeting, we discussed the different ideas, and we shortlisted 3 main ones, ranked as followed:
										<ul>
											<li>Platform to organise elections and votings - using fingerprints</li>
											<li>Platform to legalise and authenticate documents ( Virtual Notary Public )</li>
											<li>Platform concerning fair trade of manufactured products
											We need to research the resources we have for each, and choose one single idea as soon as possible</li>
										</ul>
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>15/11/2016</td>
										<td>Andy Wallace, Sadir, Kristelle</td>
										<td><b>Discussed the final idea</b> <br>In this meeting we thought again about the usefulness of the idea with our client, and the outcome was very positive. It allows international students, for example, the possibility to send documents from their university to the desired administration in their country without having to pass through a notary public, the Foreign and Commonwealth office, as well as their respective embassy. Actually, all this chain used to exist because there was no direct way to know this paper was issued from the university, but this is going to change in the near future. We talked to Andy about our research and expressed our concerns regarding certain details of the ideas, which was very helpful since we actually brainstormed together. Even though we did not find answers to all
								        our questions we decided to start experimenting with APIs and learn to use the libraries we found that could help us create the app. </td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										<td>17/01/2017</td>
										<td>Andy Wallace, Sadir, Kristelle</td>
										<td><b>Advice for the next term</b> <br>We met with our client, who was satisfied about our performance last term. He also gave us tips about planning, and highlighted the importance of testing, scalability and decision criteria. </td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										<td>15/02/2017</td>
										<td>Andy Wallace, Sadir, Alex</td>
										<td><b>Demo of our website</b> <br>We discussed the project evolution, and demoed our smart contract. Andy has also given us tips for different aspects of the project, from innovation to planning. </td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										<td>08/03/2017</td>
										<td>Andy Wallace, Sadir, Alex, Kristelle</td>
										<td><b>Demonstration and discussion</b> <br>During this meeting with our client we updated them on our progress and demonstrated the components that were working (user login, file upload, blockchain storage) integrated in a functional web application. We discussed our plans for the following weeks, and justified some technical choices we’ve made and that Andy thought we might be asked about (such as choice of mongoDB). </td>

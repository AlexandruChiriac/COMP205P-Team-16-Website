								<h3><strong>Requirements, status and contributors</strong></h3>
								<img alt="" src="images/requirements.png" style="width:80%; height:80%; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; margin-bottom: 6em;">
								<h3><strong>Challenges and how we solved them</strong></h3>

								<h4>● Challenge #1 - Unknown technologies</h4>
								<p>Our initial project consisted of coming up with an original idea related to blockchain. Not having an idea about what
								blockchain is yet needing to come up with a project was really challenging. The only way to overcome this challenge was to do a
								lot of research, and choose the final idea a bit late in the timeline</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<h4>● Challenge #2 - debugging smart contracts</h4>
								<p>Debugging smart contract solidity code was quite challenging, as it should be deployed on testRPC before any testing can be
								done, and printing variable values is hard in intermediate stages of the code. That&rsquo;s because the technology is quite
								recent.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<p>To overcome this problem, we have divided our code into very specific small functions, and the return value of each could be
								printed. This has helped us locate the bugs.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<h4>● Challenge #3 - Keeping the database and the blockchain is sync</h4>
								<p>This is a very hard task, and we needed to design our website architecture carefully, especially that we are dealing with
								sensitive data.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<p>After failing in solving the problem, we have overcome the challenge by designing our website in way that no wrong/corrupted
								data can be written to the blockchain, and where decisive and important functions would check the blockchain directly without
								relying on the mongoDB database. In other terms, we segregated the important data from the non-important ones.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<h4>● Challenge #4 - Reducing computation in the smart contracts, as it's expensive</h4>
								<p>Computation in the smart contracts costs &ldquo;gas&rdquo;, which means money if the website was deployed on the the true
								blockchain network. To minimise the gas spending, we have moved all the expensive computation outside the smart contract
								(e.g. calculating the hash of a document)</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<h4>● Challenge #5 &ndash; Slow querying of the blockchain/smart contract</h4>
								<p>Because asking for information from the blockchain is quite slow, and we sometimes need instant information to fill in a
								table with a big number of documents, we needed to find an alternative way to get data. That&rsquo;s why we initially created
								the mongoDB database as a &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; to the info in the blockchain, and which be queried faster.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<h3>Incomplete features and bugs</h3>
								<p>All the main features were successfully implemented. The only functions that could have been implemented would have been
								email notifications, and an automatic action specified by the user which happens once the document is signed.</p>
								<p>Some minor bugs still exist:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Performing actions very fast might mean that some program parts are not executed</li>
								<li>Front end elements not being well responsive</li>
								<li>No type checking: e.g. A non valid email can be entered in an email field</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We considered that these items were not required for our app prototype, and fixing these small bugs is relatively time
								consuming and wouldn't allow us to have a secure and functioning system.</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h3><strong>Work package distribution</strong></h3>

								<h2><strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Critical evaluation of the project</strong></h2>
								<img alt="" src="images/evaluation.png" style="width:80%; height:80%; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%; margin-bottom: 6em;">
								<h2><strong>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Future work</strong></h2>
								<p>Since we were allocated a disruptive project with a novel technology and not a lot of resources, we are aware that our app
								can be improved in many ways. Our future work would include:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Fixing the bugs stated earlier</li>
								<li>Moving the smart contract to a real ethereum network rather than testRPC</li>
								<li>Deploying the web app without affecting its speed and efficiency</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Later, we can move on to adding new features, such as:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Adding notifications and an authentication system</li>
								<li>Making the service for money (as transactions on the blockchain are not for free)</li>
								</ul>

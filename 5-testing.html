								<h2>a. Unit testing</h2>
								<p>To perform our testing, we used tools that are built in the frameworks we are already using.</p>
								<h4>Smart contracts</h4>
								<p>Truffle advices the use of Mocha and Chai for unit tests of smart contracts [1]. We have written tests to confirm our smart contracts behaves as expected, and this has helped find some bugs, related to signing a document twice for example. In the last stage, all the tests passed.
								<br>
								Example of a set of tests:</p>

								<br>
								<h4>Model/ Database</h4>
								<p>Chai was also used to assert that our queries are working well</p>
								<br></br><br></br>

								<h2>b. Integration testing</h2>
								<p>Because our web app’s functions directly integrates different components (database queries, web3 calls to testRPC…), it was possible to do some integration testing with chai as well. We faced some difficulties because of the client/server strict separation with meteor, and hence some functionalities couldn’t be tested.</p>

								<h2>d. Feedback from users</h2>
								<h4>Matineh Akhlaghina, Computer Science Student</h4>
								<p>"The app is very useful for me, as I’ve wasted a lot of time to get my document notarised. It looks quite straightforward, and fits well with the blockchain technology’s aim. I would definitely use it".</p>

								<h4>Joseph Sapharradoj, Mechanical Engineering student.</h4>
								<p>"The website looks nice and appealing, and the features would really helped me. I’m not sure whether this can be implemented, but I would suggest to have email notification in the future."</p>

								<h4>Laetitia Leven, Management Science student.</h4>
								<p>“The idea is simple yet extremely helpful. It actually made me understand blockchain. Regarding the web app itself, it is very simple and easy to understand, which means that non-technical users won’t suffer to know what’s happening.</p>
								<br></br><br></br>

								<h2>e. Feedback from client</h2>
								<h5>Achievement of Objectives*</h5>
								<p>As the client for this project, I confirm that all Blockdocs objectives were met. Specifically</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The team have demonstrated the Student and University user interfaces</li>
									<li>They also showed documents being uploaded, signed and verified, with multiple signatures</li>
									<li>The administrator’s interface was built though did not have a UI
										<ul>
											<li>In summary, the team were able to develop a Dual User Interface, with Admin facilities, admirably meeting all “Must Have” and “Should Have” requirements
											</li>
											<li>“could” and “would” requirements were also met, through use of open source methods such as MongoDB and Ethereum</li>
											<li>Specifically, the team should be congratulated on incorporating smart contract functionality, through the use of Ethereum to enable the addition of the uploaded document to the Blockchain</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>My advice to the team would be to continue to test the User Interface, perhaps using colleagues who are not familiar with the project objectives, in order to test how intuitive the interface would be
										<ul>
										<li>The UI was deliberately clean and minimal and pleasing to the eye, using a very modern colour palette</li>
										<li>However, one or two small “ease of use” enhancements would be helpful. The team should consider greater separation between the “upload a document” function and the document list. Also, they should consider the position on the screen of the Verify function</li>
										<li>As a customer I might be inclined to raise a Change Request to allow the Student to view the verification status of the blockchain document</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>*For the rest of our client's feedback, please vist the Management page.</p>
